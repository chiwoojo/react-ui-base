# Adding new components
Hearing the idea of this library and thinking, "This is awesome! I want to help write new components!", that's awesome! Feel free to write your component in a public repository. After you feel that it's in a pretty solid state, just open an issue and we can review your repository. Once we agree it's in a solid state, we can fork it into our repository and help you create an example page on this site. We will likely start it with the Beta flag first mainly because once it's in the larger scope, there maybe scenarios that we just didn't think of. After a set period of time, we will remove the beta flag and it's a full fledge component!
